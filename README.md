# Rails 3.1, Mongoid, Devise

This is my version of the RailsApps rails3-mongoid-devise starter application (see)[https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-devise]. This application has a very granular commit history, following the (tutorial for the app)[https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-devise/wiki/Tutorial]. In addition it starts adding Cucumber features to exercise the functionality of the application.
